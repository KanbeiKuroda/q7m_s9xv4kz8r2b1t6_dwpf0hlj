## Privacy policy

We care deeply about your privacy and believe the internet should be free, functional, and respectful of its users. That’s why we’ve designed this site to keep you completely safe while browsing:


- **No tracking:** We do not monitor your activity or collect personal data. Your visits here are entirely anonymous.

- **No ads, now or ever**: You will never see advertisements on this site. We believe the internet should prioritize creativity and knowledge, not intrusive marketing.

- **Cookies only for your convenience:** The only cookies used are to remember your theme preferences (light or dark mode). They are stored locally on your device and never sent to any server.

- **Server routing:** Our site is hosted by Cloudflare, which uses your approximate location to deliver content from the nearest server for faster loading. This process is automatic and does not store any personal information.

- **Minimal traffic statistics:** Our hosting provider, Cloudflare, automatically records basic, anonymous data for security and bandwidth purposes, such as the number of visits by country. These logs do not contain personal information or any identifiers tied to you, and cannot be used to track individual users.

- **jsDelivr, an open source CDN:** Delivers static assets (e.g., images, fonts) used on this site. jsDelivr may collect non-identifiable technical data (e.g., approximate location for server routing) but does not track users or store persistent identifiers. See [jsDelivr’s Privacy Policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net)

- **Up-to-date security:** We run the latest security protocols to ensure your connection is safe and private.

- **Third-party services:** This site may contain links to external websites or services. We do not control these sites, and they may collect data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies before interacting with them.

- **Social media sharing**: This site includes links for sharing our content on social media platforms. These are simple links and do not track you while browsing this site. If you choose to use them, you will be directed to the respective platform, which may collect information in accordance with its own privacy policy.
