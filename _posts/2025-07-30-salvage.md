In 2006, brothers Jeff and Josh Crook released *Salvage*, a horror thriller centered around Claire Parker, an ordinary girl who finds herself stalked by a strange man.
One seemingly normal day, she’s waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up when an unfamiliar man shows up driving her boyfriend’s truck. He claims her boyfriend sent him to take her home. Hesitant but ultimately choosing to believe him, Claire gets in the truck. Things quickly spiral out of control as the man begins to harass her, eventually breaking into her home and violently murdering her. But then, Claire wakes up the next morning as if nothing had happened.
"Was it all a dream, or did it actually take place?" That question haunts her as the same man begins to appear again and again, slowly pushing her into a spiral where she begins to question her own reality.

I went into this movie without many expectations, and in the end, I felt pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. _Salvage_ toys with ideas of guilt, consequences, and identity in subtle ways that only fully resonate once the credits roll. The ending is very satisfying and ties things together in a way that makes the whole experience worthwhile and self conclusive. That said, getting there might test your patience, I nearly gave up the first time I watched it, and that is because the pacing of the movie is a little inconsistent. 
It starts very strong on the first act, but around the 30 minute mark things begin to drag as Claire’s reality turns surreal and events begin repeating.
While this is justified, the execution certainly could’ve been tighter. Thankfully, once Claire begins actively investigating what’s happening to her, the pacing picks up again and maintains momentum through to the climax.

The cast made a strong effort to deliver performances that feel grounded and believable. Lauren Lewis did an amazing job portraying Claire, making the intense moments she goes through feel tense as you experience them alongside her.
The rest of the cast stays in the same line of quality, though the portrayal of Jimmy (played by Cody Darbe) feels a bit off compared to the rest. I’m not sure if it was the way he was directed or if he just wasn’t fully invested in the role, but at times he comes across like he’s in a Disney Channel show, mismatched with the tone of the film.

Visually, the film is impressive. The filmmakers manage to pull off several stylish shots, and the color grading is dominated by a cool bluish tint adds to the dreamlike, eerie atmosphere.
The visual effects are a mix of practical effects and occasional CGI, and although not groundbreaking, they’re effective enough to keep things believable.
One of the most surprising aspects of *Salvage* is its restraint. Unlike many horror films from the same era, the violent scenes are few and not overly explicit, and despite leaning into a few genre clichés like the obligatory shower scene, the directors also avoided unnecessary nudity.

The score is one of the film’s most memorable elements. It features original compositions made by Evan Wilson along with tracks from *Devola's* album “Love and War.” These tracks match the tone of the film beautifully and elevate the emotional impact of several key scenes.
One particularly striking moment near the end blends Claire’s mother’s dialogue with one of Devola’s songs so seamlessly that it feels like part of a music video.
A rare and surprisingly poetic touch is that if you pay attention to the lyrics, it feels as if the songs themselves were describing the psychological punishment.

Overall, Salvage is an intriguing experience that’s definitely worth checking out.
It’s important to note, though, that the film is clearly made for patient viewers; the horror unfolds through slow-burning suspense and tense atmosphere, rather than the explicit violence usually found in slasher-style thrillers.
I’d personally give it an 8/10. Honestly, I wish I could rate it higher because I really enjoyed it, but there are a few elements that, if improved, could’ve made it a perfect 10. Even so, it’s absolutely worth your time—if not for the clever storytelling, then at least for the soundtrack, which is brilliant.
I strongly recommend giving [Devola’s album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3LHYbdJwcoz9BiOxBKdKWe?si=P5az4vgsSD2Nn7BnoFIVPQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A3LHYbdJwcoz9BiOxBKdKWe) a listen as well. It’s a hidden gem that beautifully complements the film’s mood, and stands strong on its own, too.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆
