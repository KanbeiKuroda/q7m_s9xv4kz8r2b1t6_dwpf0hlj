*Pinocchio’s Revenge*, directed by **Kevin Tenney**, is a 1996 horror film that takes a dark twist on the classic fairy tale character. Blending courtroom drama with everyday life, the story follows a defense attorney who brings home an eerie wooden puppet linked to a death row case—only for strange events to begin unfolding around her family. While the premise starts off like another “killer doll” movie in the vein of *Child’s Play*, the film makes an effort to maintain ambiguity about the nature of the events, flirting with the idea that the puppet may truly be possessed or not, which adds a layer of psychological tension.

Is it really the doll causing harm, or was it simply the breaking point for the attorney’s daughter to lose her grip on reality?. This uncertainty is handled better than expected for a movie of its kind and gives it a slightly more cerebral edge.

Despite its obvious clichés, regular acting, and reliance on jumpscares, *Pinocchio’s Revenge* remains surprisingly entertaining. It’s not particularly scary, but it knows how to keep the viewer engaged. The performances are serviceable enough to carry the story. There’s a noticeable stiffness in the dialogue delivery that keeps the acting from feeling fully natural, but it still works well enough to remain compelling. **Rosalind Allen**, as Jennifer Garrick, stands out with a believable performance as a mother so caught between her job and personal struggles that she ends up neglecting her child.

**Brittany Alyse Smith**, who plays Zoe, also performs quite well—especially in the more emotionally charged scenes. It’s also worth noting that **Dick Beals** (best known for his voice work for the Alka Seltzer ads mascot "Speedy") provides the voice of Pinocchio. His involvement is an unexpected but oddly fitting touch, adding a strange innocence to the puppet that contrasts with his actions.

Unfortunately, while the core cast gets enough screen time, several supporting characters feel underutilized or one-dimensional, which is a missed opportunity to deepen the plot.

All things considered, *Pinocchio’s Revenge* is better than it should be. It’s flawed, sure, but it knows how to keep you watching. If you’re just looking for something entertaining to pass the time, it more than does the job. The idea of turning a classic children’s character into something sinister has always been fun, and this might be one of the earliest films to lean into that. It’s worth a watch—if not for the creepy puppet, then at least for that unexpectedly memorable shower scene.

I’d rank it a solid 5 out of 10, it’s a surprisingly enjoyable film that works better than you’d expect. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
